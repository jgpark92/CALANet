# CALANet: Cheap All-Layer Aggregation for Human Activity Recognition

## Abstract

This program (CALANet) is designed to perform the real-time sensor-based activity recognition. The CALANet includes all-layer aggregation structure that allows the classifier to aggregate features for all layer while maintaining the efficiency of conventional CNNs.

This software is a PyTorch implementation of the proposed method.
